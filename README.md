# ndg-tools

I developed the tools in this package for my own use on data science projects. These tools are in a stage of early development and not intended for general public use. Nevertheless, they are quite useful, and you are free to install this package.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ndgigliotti/ndg-tools.git@main
```
