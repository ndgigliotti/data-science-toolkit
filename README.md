# ndg-tools

I developed the tools in this package for my own use on data science projects. They are in a stage of early development and not intended for public use. Nevertheless, you are free to install them.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ndgigliotti/ndg-tools.git@main
```

# Future Work

I plan to develop subsets of the tools into specialized packages which are geared toward public use.
